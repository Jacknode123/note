## About GraphQL

GraphQL is a data query language and runtime developed by Facebook, designed to provide a more efficient, flexible, and powerful way to interact with APIs. It allows clients to request only the data they need with a single request, rather than sending multiple requests as with traditional REST APIs.

GraphQL is not just a query language; it also includes mechanisms and specifications for efficient data transfer between clients and servers.

## Features of GraphQL

1. **`Client-driven queries`**: Clients can specify the fields they need in any request, and queries do not return unnecessary data.
2. **`Single entry point`**: All requests are handled through a single interface.
3. **`Strongly typed`**: GraphQL emphasizes type definitions, and the structure of all queries and response data is predefined. The GraphQL schema describes data types, queries, and mutations.
4. **`Queries and Mutations`**:
    - **Query**: Used to request data.
    - **Mutation**: Used to modify data (e.g., create, update, delete data).
    - **Subscription**: Used to receive real-time data updates (e.g., real-time data push implemented with WebSocket).
5. **`GraphQL provides introspection`**: Allows clients to query the API schema at runtime to understand which fields, types, and operations are available.

## Basic Concepts

- **`Schema`**: The GraphQL schema defines the structure of the API, specifying the types of queries and mutations available.
- **`Query`**: Used to fetch data, similar to database queries.
- **`Mutation`**: Modifies data, such as creating, updating, and deleting resources.
- **`Resolver`**: Resolvers are functions in GraphQL that handle actual query requests, fetch, and return data. Each field has a corresponding resolver.
- **`Subscription`**: Used to implement real-time functionality (e.g., clients receive notifications immediately when data changes).

## Common Issues

1. How to handle errors in GraphQL?

  GraphQL provides an errors field in the response to report errors encountered during the query process while maintaining the integrity of other fields' data.

2. How does GraphQL implement data validation?

  Data validation is typically implemented through a combination of the GraphQL schema and resolver layer. GraphQL is strongly typed, and data validation usually occurs in the following aspects:

  - Type validation in schema definitions: GraphQL itself performs initial validation through a strict type system.
  - Additional validation in the resolver layer: In resolvers, you can add business logic validation, such as checking the validity, legality, and range of input data.

3. What is batching in GraphQL?

  Batching combines multiple GraphQL queries or operations into a single request to reduce the number of HTTP requests and improve performance.

4. How to implement pagination and filtering in GraphQL?

- **`Pagination`**
  1. Offset-based Pagination

    Define pagination parameters in the schema and implement them in the resolver.

    Similar to SQL's LIMIT and OFFSET, suitable for small datasets.

  2. Cursor-based Pagination

    Define cursor-based pagination parameters in the schema and implement them in the resolver.

    More efficient, suitable for large datasets.

- **`Filtering`**
  
  Filtering typically involves dynamically constructing query conditions based on parameters passed by the client. Similar to pagination, filtering parameters need to be defined in the schema and implemented in the resolver.

## Popular Open Source Projects

### Apollo GraphQL

Provides a complete end-to-end solution, including Apollo Server and Apollo Client.

### GraphQL-JS

The official JavaScript implementation of GraphQL, providing the foundational tools for building GraphQL APIs. All other JavaScript-related GraphQL tools (e.g., Apollo, Express-GraphQL) are built on this library.

### Hasura

An out-of-the-box GraphQL engine that automatically generates a GraphQL API from your database.
